# SHIELD ( a group project of 3)
An sos app developed to help and guide the women of BD, when they are in emergency situation. This app is built using REACT native CLI, Expo CLI, Javascript, Typescript, MongoDB and other essential APIs and libraries.
## The features we aimed 
We worked in three module. Each module aims to build minimum three main features. During the process, many features were successfully imolemented, some faced issues. The proposed features are- 
- an sos button, when pressed an alert message will go to all saved contact lists of the user. Those people need to have this app to be saved as a contact no , in the list of user.
- upon receiving the message, there will be second message - Will you volunteer?, if anoyone confirms, that respond also is sent to the user. So there is dynamic interaction among the users.
- if anyone do not want to press the sos button, but needs help, as she faced some awkward or dangerous situation, there is a guideline feature which will give guidlines like 'what you have to do next' type. We primarily gave the characteristics of three to four such circumstance which bangladeshi women face a lot. it can be further enhanced by integrating machine learning or chatbot (trained with related datas).
- There will be red zone alert system in the google map, so that when the user eneters that area, an alert message will be sent to the user, and is user wants, she can share her current location with the app. so the location tracking can be on and off. when sos button is pressed it triggers this tracking feature automatically. otherwise it will be off by default.
- Admin can manage, add/delet users account, can mark red zone in the google map, based on the feedback and response they get from the users.
- There is a library, which contains some basic laws related to women harrasement, some basic defense tools name which user can carry, some defense posture/ martial techniques description - which can be crucial in the emergency.
- Further app will keep a hospital, police station's list for each area, so that when user requests its nearby safe place or police station, it can show those lists.
